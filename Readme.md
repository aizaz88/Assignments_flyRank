# Task API

A simple in-memory CRUD API for managing a to-do list, built with Node.js and Express.

## What this is

This API lets you create, read, update, and delete tasks. Data is stored in memory only —
it resets every time the server restarts (no database yet).

## How to run it

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
npm install
node index.js
\`\`\`

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path       | Description       |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| GET    | /          | API info          |
| GET    | /health    | Health check      |
| GET    | /tasks     | List all tasks    |
| GET    | /tasks/:id | Get a single task |
| POST   | /tasks     | Create a new task |
| PUT    | /tasks/:id | Update a task     |
| DELETE | /tasks/:id | Delete a task     |

## Example request

\`\`\`
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Buy milk"}'
\`\`\`

Example response:

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"id":4,"title":"Buy milk","done":false}
\`\`\`

## Swagger UI

Interactive API docs available at `http://localhost:3000/docs` once the server is running.

## Notes

Data lives only in memory — restarting the server resets tasks back to the 3 seed examples.
